# Hi there

I’m Nischal Shrestha, a CS student at Carleton in the Software Engineering stream. I currently work as a Data Scientist with the Government of Canada (CIPO), turning messy patent data into clear, usable insights, and I also serve as a Teaching Assistant for calculus and linear algebra. I’ve shipped things people rely on—from a price tracker that actually saves money to a healthcare platform built to stay up when it matters. I like taking tangled problems and engineering clean solutions—even if it means rewriting the same function five times to get it right.

Type cd ~/projects then ls to explore some of the projects I’ve built over the years—from personal experiments to real-world applications.
